# Remote_Work_Productivity_Analysis
Remote Work Productivity Analysis explores the impact of remote work on employee productivity and well-being. Using a publicly available dataset, I've analysed how working hours and employment type which is classifed into remote and in-office, affect both productivity and well-being. The key insights of data are derived from Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis and Visualizations.

**Objective:**
The objective of this analysis is to explore how different work environments (remote and in-office) affect employee productivity and well-being. The analysis assess if remote work leads to better outcomes for employees in terms of productivity and overall well-being, and if working hours play a significant role in shaping these metrics.

**Problem Statement**
The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the following:
Are there significant differences in productivity and well-being between remote and in-office employees?
How do hours worked per week affect employee productivity? Does working more hours lead to higher productivity or is there diminishing return after certain number of hours?
How does the well-being score of employees correlate with their productivity and hours worked?

By analyzing this dataset, the goal is to provide actionable insights that can help organizations make data-driven decisions about work policies and employee support systems, promoting both productivity and well-being.
